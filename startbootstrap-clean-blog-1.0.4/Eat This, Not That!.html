<p id="2"> French fries made from white potatoes are one of the most </br>common favorite childrens food. This side dish is loaded in fats and unhealthy</br> carbohydrates that will slow you down and make your body feel heavy.</br> Try this alternative of....PURPLE POTATO FRIES!</br> Purple potatoes have healthy carbs that will not slow you down,</br> try baking them aswell, just drizzle with coconut or olive oil, </br>leave the salt out and you will have a super yummy and cool looking side that</br> I'm sure you'll be excited to it...It's PURPLE!</p></br>
<p id="3"> Spaghetti sounds so yummy specially with a ton of cheese on top, right?</br> Well this food does not have many nutrients, it doesn not really have anything</br> that will be good for you. How about switching to veggetti? </br>This is just a vegetable spaghetti, use squash instead of noodles, this one switch </br>will add a serving of vegetables to make you feel better and healthier, give it a try! </br>I promise you wont regret it!</br>
